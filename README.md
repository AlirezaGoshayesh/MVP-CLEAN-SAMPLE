# MVP Clean Sample

This repository contains a sample Android project that demonstrates the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architectural pattern combined with Clean Architecture principles. It serves as a reference implementation for building Android applications with a clean, modular, and testable codebase.

## Project Overview

The MVP Clean Sample project showcases the following key features:

- **MVP Pattern**: The project implements the MVP architectural pattern, separating the concerns of data handling, business logic, and UI presentation. This helps in maintaining a clear separation of responsibilities and enhances code readability and maintainability.

- **Clean Architecture**: The project follows the principles of Clean Architecture, promoting a clear separation of layers and dependencies. It consists of three layers: the presentation layer (UI), the domain layer (business logic), and the data layer (data sources and repositories). This architectural approach provides flexibility, testability, and scalability to the application.
